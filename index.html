        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi! My name is Diana Cortez. I am a second-year full-time student, as well as a first-generation student. I am currently studying at the University of California, Riverside. I am currently studying in the field of Sociology and pursuing a minor in Spanish. I also work part-time at Walmart, where I have learned numerous skills such as customer service, organizational skills, sorting, and problem-solving. As a natural leader, I thrive on inspiring and motivating those around me. I believe in fostering a collaborative environment where each team member can contribute their unique talents and ideas. By nurturing strong relationships built on trust and open communication, I have cultivated high-performing teams that consistently exceed expectations.<br><br>

        I love being part of the university community. Some of the activities I have been part of were becoming a member of A Friend in Me, an organization where I can contribute to the community with community services, helping those in need, and working with patients at hospitals, especially kids. I had the opportunity to meet such great people and I have become great friends. Outside of school, I like to help some of my neighbors and family members with their homework, and on some occasions, I have the opportunity to help my community by cleaning parks, and streets. I like to help my community among other things.
Here is a little bit about myself. Born and raised in Los Angeles, California, I cultivated a thirst for knowledge and exploration from an early age. This curiosity led me to pursue a degree in Sociology from the University of California, Riverside. During my academic journey, I delved into various subjects, honing my skills and developing a solid foundation for my future. In addition to my professional pursuits, I am a firm believer in maintaining a healthy work-life balance. I find solace in mentioning hobbies, which allow me to unwind and recharge. These activities not only bring me joy but also contribute to my overall well-being and creativity. For instance, some of my hobbies I have is that I like to go hiking two times a week, especially, Saturday and Sunday. I also loved to spend time with my family and friends, love travel, and read. I am very open to learning and experiencing new things.
<br><br>

        I would describe myself as a very positive person, friendly toward others, attentive, and organized. Some will say that I am a multifaceted individual driven by a deep passion for personal and professional growth. I am known for my unwavering commitment to personal growth and self-improvement. I actively seek out opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills, staying up-to-date with the latest trends and news. I am well aware that with this dedication I can and will be able to achieve great things and succeed. For this sole reason, I have planned my goals from an early age. That is to work at a hospital or clinic with children as a psychologist with a bachelor's in Psychology and a minor in Spanish.
